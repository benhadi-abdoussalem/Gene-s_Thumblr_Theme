# Gene-s_Thumblr_Theme

Gene needs an awesome Tumblr blog, and I look like just the person to do it.
here i'm doing:

1. Header Than Average
2. Classing it up!
3. Blocks That Rocks!
4. Making the Most of Posts
5. Hit all the right notes
6. Pages for the Ages

In Section one and two "Header Than Average Classing it up!" I will:
1- Use tags and variables to grab and place content in my Tumblr theme
2- Format variables with HTML and CSS.
3- format the text in the header.
4- Position the header's content.

In Section three "Blocks That Rocks!" I will:
1- Do some {TemplateTag} housekeeping in my header.
2- Create a place to put blog posts!

In section four "Making the most of posts" I will cover:
1- How to tell Tumblr to create a photo post
2- Make posts look good
3- Some more post types

In section five "Hitting all the right notes!" I will cover:
1- Make the posts likable and shareable.
2- Brag (a little) about how well-loved you are.
