# Gene-s_Thumblr_Theme

Gene needs an awesome Tumblr blog, and I look like just the person to do it.
here i'm doing:

1. Header Than Average
2. Classing it up!
3. Blocks That Rocks!
4. Making the Most of Posts
5. Hit all the right notes
6. Pages for the Ages

In Section one "Header Than Average Classing it up!" I will:
1- Use tags and variables to grab and place content in my Tumblr theme
2- Format variables with HTML and CSS.
3- format the text in the header.
4- Position the header's content.

In Section two "Blocks That Rocks!" I will:
1- Do some {TemplateTag} housekeeping in my header.
2- Create a place to put blog posts!
